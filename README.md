# NHPP Drought Modeling
In this project, we present our findings from evaluating the research conducted by [Achcar et al. (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299355797_Use_of_non-homogeneous_Poisson_process_NHPP_in_presence_of_change-points_to_analyze_drought_periods_a_case_study_in_Brazil), which involves the use of a ***non-homogeneous Poisson process*** (NHPP) in the presence of change-points to study drought periods.
